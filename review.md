This is a very interesting paper that researched the Deep-Q based DRL agents for the job-shop problem by the discrete event simulation for production facilities. Their work is well studied and presented. However, there are some limitations that are opened for future work. I have the following to be considered by the authors:
1) Some of the agents names need to be mentioned fully: like DRL what is its full name? list all similar names in the text. You may use notation table for all of them for the readers benefit.
2) Page 6 - Line 16: what is the usage of serialize and deserialize.
3) Page 6 - Line 57: (b) .... until all GVs have a job. Then in (8) ... the simulation starts, why? is there a constraint, commitment, or the simulation nature? explain.
4) Figure 1, 2, 3: for the red numbers are they the maximum number of parts? and the arrows are they the movements? define them in the text.
5) Table 1: it is name is not mentioned in the text.
6) Table 2: environment "Mayer-Classen-Endisch", why 1 AVG, 3 AVGs, and 4 AGVs are not tested? same for "1-machine-big". Also, "3-machine-loop" 4 AGVs is not tested.
7) Page 15 - Line 45: 23 parts/hour. However, in the table is 23.6? for numbers some are same and some are rounded? check all numbers in the text, either put the exact digit or round with explanation.
8) Figure 4: also the numbers are rounded on the bars are rounded?
Thanks and good luck,



# Reviewer #2

This study investigates the feasibility of deploying Deep-Q-based deep reinforcement learning agents to job-shop scheduling problems in the context of modular production facilities, using discrete event simulations for the environment. The paper is good to be considered for any possible publication. However, there are some comments to improve it as follows:
1) Focus more on the main contributions in the abstract and revise it.
2) Add some papers published recently to the literature review. Also, more papers are needed to be reviewed.
3) Some suggestions to improve the literature review section.
4) Clarify and explain your work contributions and the research gap in an appropriate section such as at the end of the introduction.
5) Describe the methodology in sub-section 2.3.3. more clear.
6) What is the source of the conducted benchmark?
7) Explain Figure 4 more.
8) Provide some managerial insights.
9) Expand the key results in the conclusion. Focus on the main results in the conclusion. Also, write the main contributions in the conclusion.
10) Explain the below links:
